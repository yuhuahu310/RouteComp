# RouteComp

RouteComp is a frontend website that allows users to compare routes from the same starting location to multiple destinations in a single webpage. It offers travel information including travel distance and time, and updates these information simultaneously as different travel methods are chosen. It also rates the safety level of different routes by offering crime score and crime grade. These essential route information help users compare similar destinations they want to go and make a fast and informed decision.

The crime score and crime grade are placeholders for now. In future development, the website will be connected to a crime database in the backend to reflect real-life and accurate crime data.
